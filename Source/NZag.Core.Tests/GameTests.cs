West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.
There is a small mailbox here.

>N
North of House
You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.

>N
Forest Path
This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.

>U
Up a Tree
You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.
You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
>GET EGG

>S
East of Chasm
You are on the east edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be seen. A narrow passage goes north, and the path you are on continues to the east.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

>E
Gallery
This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste. The vandals left through either the north or west exits.
Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on the far wall is a painting of unparalleled beauty.

>N
The Troll Room
This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.
The troll's axe barely misses your ear.

>KILL TROLL

The troll hits you with a glancing blow, and you are momentarily stunned.

>KILL TROLL
(with the sword)
You are still recovering from that last blow, so your attack is ineffective.
The troll swings his axe, but it misses.

>KILL TROLL
(with the sword)
A furious exchange, and the troll is knocked out!

>KILL TROLL
(with the sword)
The unarmed troll cannot defend himself: He dies.
Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

>DROP SWORD
Dropped.Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the walls here. He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that the bag will be taken only over his dead body.

>E
East-West Passage

>TIE ROPE TO RAILING
The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.

>D
Torch Room
This is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down staircase. Above you is a large dome. Up around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing. In the center of the room sits a white marble pedestal.
A piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some five feet above your head.Sitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.

>S
Temple
This is the north end of a large temple. On the east wall is an ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the prayer is a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to the north end of the room is through huge marble pillars.

Canyon View
You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream. Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the mighty ramparts of the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a great dark cavern. To the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.

>D
Rocky Ledge
You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon. You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a passage which it is impossible for you to enter. Below you is the canyon bottom. Above you is more cliff, which appears climbable.

>D
Canyon Bottom
You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable here. The lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls flows by below. To the north is a narrow path.

>N
End of Rainbow
You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid River past the Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White Cliffs. The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A rainbow crosses over the falls to the east and a narrow path continues to the southwest.

>WAVE SCEPTRE
Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture, walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
A shimmering pot of gold appears at the end of the rainbow.

>E
On the Rainbow
You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the Falls. The rainbow travels east-west here.

>E
Aragain Falls
You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a drop of about 450 feet. The only path here is on the north end.
A solid rainbow spans the falls.

>N
Shore
You are on the east shore of the river. The water here seems somewhat treacherous. A path travels from north to south here, the south end quickly turning around a sharp corner.

>N
Sandy Beach
You are on a large sandy beach on the east shore of the river, which is flowing quickly by. A path runs beside the river to the south here, and a passage is partially buried in sand to the northeast.
There is a shovel here.

Cyclops Room
This room has an exit on the northwest, and a staircase leading up.
A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses(much less mere adventurers), blocks the staircase.From his state of health, and the bloodstains on the walls, you gather that he is not very friendly, though he likes people.
> GIVE LUNCH AND WATER TO CYCLOPS
 lunch: The cyclops says ""Mmm Mmm. I love hot peppers! But oh, could I use a drink. Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing.""  From the gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are ""that thing"".
quantity of water: The cyclops takes the bottle, checks that it's open, and drinks the water. A moment later, he lets out a yawn that nearly blows you over, and then falls fast asleep (what did you put in that drink, anyway?).

> DROP BOTTLE
 You don't have the glass bottle.

 > U
You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway. Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room suddenly vanish.

Treasure Room
This is a large room, whose east wall is solid granite. A number of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on the floor. There is an exit down a staircase.
There is a suspicious - looking individual, holding a large bag, leaning against one wall.He is armed with a deadly stiletto.
 There is a silver chalice, intricately engraved, here.
The thief stabs nonchalantly with his stiletto and misses.

> GIVE EGG TO THIEF
 The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity, but accepts the jewel - encrusted egg and stops to admire its beauty.
   > KILL THIEF

> KILL THIEF
(with the nasty knife)
The unarmed thief cannot defend himself: He dies.
Almost as soon as the thief breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his treasures reappear:
  A leather bag of coins
  A jewel - encrusted egg, with a golden clockwork canary
    A stiletto

The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your attempts to pass.
> RING BELL
 The bell suddenly becomes red hot and falls to the ground. The wraiths, as if paralyzed, stop their jeering and slowly turn to face you.On their ashen faces, the expression of a long-forgotten terror takes shape.

 Each word of the prayer reverberates through the hall in a deafening confusion.As the last word fades, a voice, loud and commanding, speaks: ""Begone, fiends!"" A heart-stopping scream fills the cavern, and the spirits, sensing a greater power, flee through the walls.
